KoalaGame
=========

This game has three different mini-game-style-things in it. The first is tree punching. You punch leaves off trees because climbing the tree is for people who aren't lazy. The next is leaf-flipping. You're picky and like all your leaves oriented the same way before you eat them. You're paws are big and clumsy, so you have to flip multiple leaves at a time, which makes the game actually difficult. Once you've eaten lots of leaves you punch more trees to get more leaves. You also get fatter, so your paws get bigger and more clumsy, making you have to flip more leaves at a time. Eventually (upon pressing T) you fall into a cave and run for your life. You get points for hallucinating (what?).
